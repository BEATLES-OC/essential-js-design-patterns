#### Introduction

This is the repo for an in-progress book I'm writing called 'Essential JavaScript Design Patterns'. 
It is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial- No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License and will be out 
via O'Reilly Media shortly.

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software development and are a very useful tool to have at your disposal. You can read the latest version [online](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/ "Read Online") at
any time. 

Version 1.5.2 of the book is currently over 160 A4 pages in length and 1.0 was downloaded approximately 260,000 times (rounded) during 2011. Additional formats of the book are available in the 'formats' directory.

#### Why is this book needed?

I wanted to write this book as I felt that patterns were an area a lot of new and intermediate JavaScript developers may not have had a chance to explore just yet and I'm hopeful my book will encourage you to check them out as they can be quite powerful.

#### Reporting Issues or content requests

For any issues related to EJDP, please feel free to open up an issue through the repo. I'll be regularly checking the blog comments and making weekly updates as time allows but trackable issues through github are preferred.

Thanks for reading and I hope this comes in useful.
